							<h2><p>How does social media really affect the brain?</h2></p>
							<p>"Overheated public and clinical concerns about problematic Internet, cell phone, and social media use risk demonizing technologies that have a positive impact on the mental health of most adults,” Hampton says. “Generally, the protective relationship between information and communication technologies and psychological distress is only reduced due to social conditions beyond an individual’s control. Instructing people to avoid others online who are experiencing distress, for fear of ‘catching’ anxiety or depression, is antithetical to the goal of developing positive personality traits related to perspective taking and empathic concern. Such instruction removes a new and increasingly important means for people to communicate their problems and become aware of the need to provide social support."</p>
